## DeepV Code Added Memories
- User is building a Next.js technical articles website with upstream workflow integration from ../deepv-stackoverflow-workflow-complete. The site uses MDX articles with YAML frontmatter, JSON-based article indexing, and supports 10K+ articles across 5 categories: databases, mobile, programming-languages, system-devops, web-frontend. Filename format: {descriptive-title}-{uniqueId}.mdx. Uses 'description' field (not 'excerpt') for SEO. Site has working search, category/subcategory pages, and builds successfully.
- User is building "DeepV Code" - an AI-powered technical documentation platform that automatically transforms Stack Overflow content into enterprise-grade, SEO-optimized articles. This represents the next trend: AI content curation and systematization at scale. Target: 10K+ articles. Architecture: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, designed for search engine dominance. This is likely a serious business venture to compete with GeeksforGeeks/MDN using automated content transformation.
- User's "deepv-stackoverflow-workflow-complete" is an AI pipeline that converts raw Stack Overflow Q&A into comprehensive technical articles with sophisticated metadata (difficulty, readTime, SEO descriptions, technology tags). This automation of technical writing represents a major shift from individual AI content generation to systematic knowledge transformation and curation platforms.
- For this Next.js technical articles website: ALWAYS follow Next.js rules and conventions. Never rebuild existing Next.js functionality. The upstream workflow outputs articles that must match exact format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter, filename format {descriptive-title}-{uniqueId}.mdx, using 'description' field (not excerpt), placed in /content/guides/, with article-index.json updates. Build must always pass without errors.
- Navigation structure: Categories and subcategories are defined in /content/config/categories.json. This is the source of truth for all valid category/subcategory combinations. Always reference this file to understand the site structure. Current categories: databases, mobile, programming-languages, system-devops, web-frontend with their respective subcategories.
- DeepV Code is a Next.js 15 technical documentation platform deployed at https://deepvcode.com/ using ISR architecture. Main repo: git@github.com:thaddeus-git/nextjs-deepv-docs.git, Content repo: git@github.com:thaddeus-git/nextjs-deepv-content.git. Uses external GitHub content fetching with ISR for 100K+ article scalability on Vercel.
- DeepV Code architecture uses content separation strategy: code repository deploys to Vercel (~456KB), content repository stores MDX articles separately. ISR pre-renders only featured articles at build time, generates other pages on-demand. Environment variables needed: CONTENT_REPO_URL and GITHUB_TOKEN for GitHub API content fetching.
- For DeepV Code upstream workflow: articles output to /nextjs-deepv-content/staging/ directory (not main repo), validated then moved to /nextjs-deepv-content/guides/, then git push triggers ISR updates. Uses MDX with YAML frontmatter, filename format {descriptive-title}-{uniqueId}.mdx, requires 'description' field for SEO.
- DeepV Code project configuration is centralized in /config/ directory with project.json (core project info), content-schema.json (MDX article requirements), tech-stack.json (complete technology stack), and README.md (usage guide). This is the authoritative source for all project specifications instead of remembering individual field requirements.
- DeepV Code ISR Content Lifecycle: Upstream generates → /nextjs-deepv-content/staging/guides/ → (optional validation) → move to /nextjs-deepv-content/guides/ → git push → ISR auto-revalidates in 5 minutes. No manual curl commands needed. Two repos: code (nextjs-deepv-docs) and content (nextjs-deepv-content). Schema defined in /config/content-schema.json.
- For DeepV Code architecture: Use schema duplication pattern for decoupling. Main repo owns authoritative schemas, content repo gets copies for independence. Manual sync when schemas change (rare). This ensures zero coupling between repositories while maintaining validation capabilities. Apply this pattern to all shared configuration files.
- For DeepV Code project: Articles MUST have unique 8-character hex IDs (pattern: ^[a-f0-9]{8}$) extracted from filenames. URL structure is MANDATORY: /guides/{slug}-{id} format. This is established in config/article-index-schema.json and config/content-schema.json. Filename pattern: {slug}-{id}.mdx. All components must use article.id for URL generation.
- When raising questions about project decisions, always write them to ./questions_by_AI.md file for user to fill in answers, rather than asking directly in chat
- Successfully deployed DeepV Code hybrid architecture: ISR content fetching system + standard Next.js responsive design. Fixed environment variable issues, removed complex custom mobile components, kept staging workflow scripts. Build output: 47 pages, 125kB bundle, 5-minute ISR revalidation. Mobile responsiveness achieved through standard Tailwind classes in layout.tsx header. Deployed to https://deepvcode.com via Vercel.
- DeepV Code uses ISR with external content repository via GitHub API. Content repo URL defined in config files. Issue: Mermaid flowchart code blocks (```flowchart TD) not rendering as diagrams - need to add Mermaid.js support to the site. Also need to consider language specification for code blocks in upstream content generation.
- DeepV Code has streamlined to 5 essential schemas for upstream integration: 1) content-schema.json v3.0.0 (merged with SEO requirements), 2) content-templates.json (examples and templates), 3) article-index-schema.json (URL patterns), 4) categories.json (navigation), 5) project.json (architecture). Master index file: upstream-schemas-index.json contains all URLs and integration workflow for upstream consumption.
- DeepV Code has working Mermaid.js support integrated via MermaidDiagram.tsx and MDXComponents.tsx. Code blocks with language 'mermaid' automatically render as visual diagrams. All code blocks now require language specification - zero tolerance policy enforced via validation scripts.
- DeepV Code schema ecosystem completed as milestone: 5 essential schemas (content-schema v3.3.0, content-templates v1.2.0, article-index-schema v1.1.0, categories.json, project.json) with complete image integration, Mermaid support, and accurate SEO guidelines. All schemas verified Next.js compatible with no artificial character limits. Master index URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaddeus-git/nextjs-deepv-docs/main/config/upstream-schemas-index.json
- DeepV Code corrected major SEO misconceptions: removed artificial 70-character title limits based on research showing Google has no indexing character limits for titles. Schema now provides accurate SEO guidance based on official Google sources, not industry myths. Next.js framework has no character restrictions in metadata API.
- DeepV Code image workflow: upstream generates ![Title](PLACEHOLDER: description) + {8-char-hex-id}-{kebab-case-title}.png files in staging/images/, scripts convert placeholders to Next.js Image components, promotion moves staging/images/ to images/, final URLs /images/filename.png with 800px width, responsive sizing, and WebP optimization.
