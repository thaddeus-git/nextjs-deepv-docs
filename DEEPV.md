## DeepV Code Added Memories
- User is building a Next.js technical articles website with upstream workflow integration from ../deepv-stackoverflow-workflow-complete. The site uses MDX articles with YAML frontmatter, JSON-based article indexing, and supports 10K+ articles across 5 categories: databases, mobile, programming-languages, system-devops, web-frontend. Filename format: {descriptive-title}-{uniqueId}.mdx. Uses 'description' field (not 'excerpt') for SEO. Site has working search, category/subcategory pages, and builds successfully.
- User is building "DeepV Code" - an AI-powered technical documentation platform that automatically transforms Stack Overflow content into enterprise-grade, SEO-optimized articles. This represents the next trend: AI content curation and systematization at scale. Target: 10K+ articles. Architecture: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, designed for search engine dominance. This is likely a serious business venture to compete with GeeksforGeeks/MDN using automated content transformation.
- User's "deepv-stackoverflow-workflow-complete" is an AI pipeline that converts raw Stack Overflow Q&A into comprehensive technical articles with sophisticated metadata (difficulty, readTime, SEO descriptions, technology tags). This automation of technical writing represents a major shift from individual AI content generation to systematic knowledge transformation and curation platforms.
- For this Next.js technical articles website: ALWAYS follow Next.js rules and conventions. Never rebuild existing Next.js functionality. The upstream workflow outputs articles that must match exact format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter, filename format {descriptive-title}-{uniqueId}.mdx, using 'description' field (not excerpt), placed in /content/guides/, with article-index.json updates. Build must always pass without errors.
- Navigation structure: Categories and subcategories are defined in /content/config/categories.json. This is the source of truth for all valid category/subcategory combinations. Always reference this file to understand the site structure. Current categories: databases, mobile, programming-languages, system-devops, web-frontend with their respective subcategories.
