If you zoom in and out on that example, the overlayed image stays in the right position. In the code, displayed under the map, you can find a function called \"overlayProjection.fromLatLngToDivPixel\". I can imagine this will allow you to translate a LatLng to pixels. Using those pixels you might be able to change the dimension of your overlay SVG. Sorry, it's all I could come up with, it's not gonna be easy.",

In your example, if I change the stroke to 33 I get the same result if I put the stroke to 200 or 2000, and that's the problem, I need a big and real width. Another problem is the zoom, I need the real width when I use the zoom, but my first problem is get a big width. Maybe using another object?",

The polyline width will always be THAT weight, it doesn't matter wether you zoom, it will be the exact same size on your screen. So weight 10 with a map zoom of 8 will look the same as weight 10 with a map zoom of 3. Is this what you mean with \"real width\"? What exactly is it you are trying to achieve?",
